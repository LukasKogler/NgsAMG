Algebraic Multigrid Preconditioners for NGSolve.

Supports H1 and elasticity problems.

This package needs NGSolve to be built with MPI. For the elasticity AMG component,
NGSolve also has to be built with LAPACK and MAX_SYS_DIM 6 or higher.

Paths to headers of some external NGSolve projects (metis, mumps, umfpack, ..) sometimes
need to explicitely given to cmake

cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-I/path_to_these_headers"
