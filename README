Algebraic Multigrid Preconditioners for NGSolve.

Supports H1 and elasticity problems.

The library can be installed via pip:

    python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/LukasKogler/NgsAMG.git

This package needs NGSolve to be built with MPI. For the elasticity AMG component,
NGSolve also has to be built with LAPACK and MAX_SYS_DIM 6 or higher.

The library can also be used with non-python NGSolve builds, but that requires building from source.
